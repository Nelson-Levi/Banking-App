## Overview

**Project Title**: Banking App

**Project Description**: This program allows users to create, deposit into, withdraw from, and save bank accounts. This will assist users in keeping track of their banking information. Users must log in or create an account with a username and password. Accounts are then saved behind each user's information.

**Project Goals**:
1. Demonstrate understanding and profiency of the Java language
2. Practice the four pillars of object-oriented programming through abstraction of classes, encapsulation of variables, inheritance through derived classes, and polymorphism with overridden methods. 
3. Demonstrate knowledge of Java syntax and conventions.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Open the Program.cs file in Visual Studio Code.
2. From the upper menu, select Run Run Without Debugging.
3. Alternatively, while viewing the Program.cs file in Visual Studio Code, use Ctrl + F5 keyboard shortcut.

Instructions for using the software:

1. Create a user account and open your first bank account.
2. Log in with username and password.
3. Use the menu to view balance, withdraw and deposit, open new accounts, and save information.

## Development Environment

## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [W3schools Java Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
* [Stack Overflow (there were several Stack Overflow threads I visited, this is just one of many)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53210804/getting-undefined-with-static-get)
* [Official Java Documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/24/index.html)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [ ] I will use Kotlin to develop this into a mobile app.
* [ ] I will edit the program so it does not end after new account creation.
* [ ] I will find a more secure way to store usernames and passwords, like a database.
